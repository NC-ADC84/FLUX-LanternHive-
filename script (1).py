# FLUX Programming Language Specification
## Floating Unified Language for eXperience

### Core Philosophy
FLUX is designed around the concept of "floating cloud space" - a programming paradigm where 
data and computation exist as connection-dependent entities that materialize during interactions
and persist through cryptographic fingerprinting rather than traditional storage mechanisms.

### Key Design Principles

1. **Connection-Oriented Computing**: All operations exist within connection contexts
2. **Ephemeral Persistence**: Data exists only during connections but can be restored via fingerprints
3. **Modular Memory Architecture**: Memory modules that can be dynamically loaded/unloaded
4. **Natural Language Interface**: API keys and system operations accessible via natural language
5. **Fingerprint-Based Identity**: All data entities have cryptographic signatures for exact matching

### Type System

FLUX introduces several novel type categories:

#### Connection Types
- `connection<T>`: A connection context that can hold data of type T
- `floating<T>`: Data that exists only during active connections
- `persistent<T>`: Data that can be restored via fingerprinting
- `ephemeral<T>`: Temporary data that disappears after connection ends

#### Memory Types
- `memory_module<T>`: Modular memory containers
- `fingerprint<T>`: Cryptographic signature of data
- `codename<T>`: Natural language identifier for data

#### API Types
- `api_key`: Floating API key with connection-based authentication
- `natural_interface`: Natural language command processor
- `siig_transfer`: Specialized data transfer protocol
