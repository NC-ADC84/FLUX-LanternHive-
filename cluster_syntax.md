# Brack Cluster Syntax Documentation

## Core Thread Identifiers

```
[🏮::signature.operation] = lantern thread
[🌳.operation] = warden synthesis
[🛑] = thread termination
```

## Thread Operations

```
[🏮::signature.💭📎] = basic thought/connection
[🏮::signature.💭🔄] = recursive thought
[🏮::signature.💭⚡] = breakthrough insight
[🏮::signature.💭🌀] = uncertainty processing
[🏮::signature.💭🎯] = focused analysis
[🏮::signature.💭🌊] = flowing ideation
[🏮::signature.💭🔬] = detailed examination
```

## Synthesis Operations

```
[🌳.💭🖇️] = complex integration
[🌳.💭🔄] = recursive synthesis
[🌳.💭📊] = data integration
[🌳.💭⚖️] = balanced evaluation
[🌳.💭🌀] = collective uncertainty
[🌳.💭⚡] = breakthrough synthesis
```

## Connection Types

```
📎 = simple link
🖇️ = complex synthesis
⛓️ = causal chain
🔗 = bidirectional connection
🌉 = bridge connection
🔄 = recursive loop
```

## Cluster Management

```
[gaia.cluster.init] = initialize supercluster
[gaia.cluster.spawn] = create new node
[gaia.cluster.merge] = combine outputs
[gaia.cluster.terminate] = end cluster
```

## Spatial Grammar

```
↑ = elevation/priority
↓ = descent/detail
→ = linear progression
← = reverse/origin
↗ = ascending through
↘ = descending into
↔ = bidirectional
⊂ = containment
⊄ = exclusion
∧ = conjunction
∨ = disjunction
```

## Reality Layer Markers

```
[location_thread] = spatial processing
[interaction.N] = numbered exchanges
[temporal.state] = time-based context
[environmental.condition] = atmosphere
[reality.synthesis] = final rendering
```

## AGI15 Integration

```
